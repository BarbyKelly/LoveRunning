    <!-- all of html disappeared from VS Code, when I went to delete 
    couple of empty spaces between meta name. I copy and pasted my html
    from diffchecker back as I had been working on checking the differences.
    Ctrl-z did not bring back what I had already done in html. I had pushed it 
    to github on Friday, looks ok there. While typing this, all of html disappeared again,
    this time I noticed arrows beside numbers, and after clicking was able to see all of html code-->
